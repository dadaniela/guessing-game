Explorer is a series of different projects I’m building to learn web development from HTML and CSS to JS and ReactJS whilst also practicing UX/UI design and accessibility concepts.
It’s one of the courses offered by [rocketseat.com.br](https://rocketseat.com.br)

### Guessing game

In this project I was introduced to some JS concepts such as events and callback functions.
The game generates a random number in the background and asks the user to guess that number, it keeps track of how many times she tried to guess it and once the input number matches with the randomly generated number, a new message showing the number of attempts will be displayed. The user can then click on play again.
